R1 = 322 Kilo-Ohms
R2 = 9.8 Kilo-Ohms

(a) For inputs of:
	1.1V- Output Voltage = 0.0325V
	2.2V- Output = 0.0650V
	3.3V- Output = 0.0975
(b) Using dacdemo and adcdemo:
	1.1 - 0.032V
	2.2 - 0.066V
	3.3 - 0.098V
(c) The error between predicted output voltage and actual output voltage is approximately 0.0005V, 
which is an error of 1.53 - 0.5 percent error depending on the input voltage. Now, output error of 
the MCP4725(DAC) is 0.5mV, and the output error of ADS1015(ADC) is really small, and can be treated 
as zero. Hence, the total error due to the discrete nature of DAC output and ADC input is approximately 
0.0005V. We can find the error due to the resistances by error propagation of the function V_out = V(R1,R2), 
where R1 and R2 are the resistances of the two resistors, each with a 5 percent toerance. After an arrangement of equation, 
it is found that V = V_in*R2/(R1 + R2). By error propagation, delta(V) = sqrt((delta(R1)*dV/dR1)^2+(delta(R2)*dV/dR2)^2).
Plugging in the numbers, we find that delta(V) due to the resistors is approximately 0.00446V. Hence, the largest source 
of error would be due to the tolerances of the resistors.
