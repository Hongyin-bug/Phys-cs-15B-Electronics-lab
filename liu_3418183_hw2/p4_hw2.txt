(a) The dominant frequency is f = 1/T = 1/(0.01s) \approx 100Hz
(b) After I ran the program, the elapsed time is approximately 4.08sec,
which is twice the time of the set data acquisition time (2.0s). 
This data isn't trustworthy, as the hardware and software speeds could be
less than 3300 step/sec. The code require an acquisition time of 2 sec, 
meaning that to go through 6600 steps. However, if the processing speed
of a hardware on the breadboard has a processing speed of 1/1500 seconds/step,
the total time taken would be 4.4 seconds, which is longer than the acquisition time.
Hence, some steps might not have been run, and the python script is not fully executed,
so the data is not trustworthy.
