(a) By figure 2 on page 3, there is a linear relationship between
voltage (V) and the Magnetic Range (Gauss). This relationship folows
the equation V = (3/2000)B + 2.5, where B is the magnetic field strength.
This is for a supply voltage of 5 Vdc, but the supplied voltage here is
3.3 V, so the slope for the graph is different. By the last figure on page 4,
The slope is given by 0.00027 (V/Gauss/V) * 3.3 V = 8.91 * 10^(-4) V/Gauss.
The initial voltage shown on the monitor is 1.696V. Hence, the modified formula:
V = (8.91 * 10^(-4))B + 1.696, so B = (V - 1.696) * 10^(-4)/8.91
By the formula B = u_0*u/(2pi*z^3), where z is the distance from the center
of the magnet to the sensor, and u_0 is the permeability of free space
u_0 = 1.257 * 10^(-6) mkgs^-2A^-2, one can calculate the magnetic dipole moment u:
u = (2pi/u_0) B*z^3.
Note: The distance z is when the orientation of the dipole is aliged to the 
electric field of the sensor; this is when the magnet is horizontally above 
the sensor. 
Data is shown below, with B converted to Tesla by 1 Gauss = 10^(-4) Tesla:
Trial	z(m)	V(volts)	B(Tesla)	u(Am^2)	  Uncertainty
  1	0.0015	1.72		26.94		0.454		0.91
  2	0.003	1.70		4.49		0.605		0.61
  3     0.005	1.698		2.24		1.40		0.84
  4	0.01	1.696		0		0		N/A
The average magnetic moment u = 0.72 Am^2. 
The uncertainty is due to the inaccuracy in measuring the distance z,
the uncertainty is 0.001m. By the formula du = (du/dz)*dz, where du/dz
is the derivative of u with respect to z about a certain distance z,
and dz = 0.001. The calculated uncertainties are shown in table above.
The average uncertainty is 0.787 Am^2.


(b) Magnetization = du/dV, where u = magnetic dipole moment.
The measured volume of the magnet is V = (pi)*(0.004m)^2 *(0.003m).
It is given that M is approximately 10^6 A/m. Then the magnetic dipole
moment is u = MV, which is approximately 0.151 Am^2. The calculated value is 
much larger than my measurement. This might be due to the inaccuracy in 
measuring the distance z, as a small fluctuation of z will lead to a third
power error in the magnetic dipole moment u. Also, the calculated value is 
within the uncertainty range of plus or minus 0.787.
