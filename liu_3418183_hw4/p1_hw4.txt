(a) When DAC is set to 0.000V, the opamp output is 0.004V.
 DAC set to 1.100V, opamp output: 1.100V
 DAC set to 2.200V, opamp output: 2.204V
 DAC set to 3.300V, opamp output: 3.288V
For certain voltages set at the DAC, the opamp output differs by 0.002V to 0.004V.

The difference in voltage across the resistor, v_in - v23 for 1.1V and 3.3V are:
1.1V: V = 1.1V - 1.1V = 0V; current I = V/R = 0 Amps
3.3V: V = 3.2880 - 2.030 = 1.258V; current I = V/R = 1.258V/100ohm = 12.58 milli-amps.

(b) Using two voltage readings could reduce the errors in determinig the current,
such as that due to the resistance of the wires.

(c) Maximum DAC voltage is 3.6V, analog input A2 will draw a current of 
I = 3.6V/(4.3 * 10^6 ohms) = 8.4 * 10^(-5) Amps, which is really small.
The corresponding voltage drop acoss the resistor is approximately 1.27V.
The input impedance of the ADC does not make a significant difference in the
measurement as it only draws a small amount of current from the resistor,
so we could use it as a voltmeter.

(d) The minimum DAC voltage to produce light is 1.6V, and the corresponding LED
current is approximately 2 * 10^-5 Amps. The color of the LED is red.

(e) This time, the minimum DAC voltage to produce light is greater, the value
being 2.42V, and the corresponding current is approximately 2 * 10^-5 Amps. 
The color of the LED is blue.
