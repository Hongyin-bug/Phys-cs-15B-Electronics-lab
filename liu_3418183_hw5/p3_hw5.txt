(a) When not sure of the orientation, one could first measure the initial absolute
value of each component of the acceleration and add it to a list labeled as accel0 
(this would include the acceleration contribution from Earth's gravity and some small 
fluctuations), wait a really short period of time (e.g. 1ms), then measure the absolute 
value of each component of acceleration again and add them to the list labeled as accel1.
The net instantaneous acceleration would then be sqrt(sum(|accel1[i] - accel0[i]|^2)),
where i is the element in each list indicating the measured initial and final values of
each acceleration component.

(b) See code.
