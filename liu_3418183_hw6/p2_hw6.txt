(a) The heater has such a low resistance as it acts like a wire. 
Voltage to heater of 3.6 ohms to produce 10W heating: V = sqrt(PR) = 6V.
Voltage needed for a 100 kilo-ohms: = sqrt(10^6) = 1kV.
(b) The resistance of 04T1003FP thermister at 25 degrees Celcius is 10 kilo-ohms.
When the temperature drops to 22 degrees, the resistance will be higher according to the data sheet.
(c) Voltage across the resistor is measured by pins A2 and A3 of the ADC, denoted as v23.
Voltage across the whole circuit is measured by pins A0 and A1 of the ADC, denoted as v01.
Voltage across the resistance is vt = v01 - v23.
Current through resistor is I = v23/(10^5 ohms); this is also the current across the circuit.
Hence, the resistance of the thermister is Rt = Vt/I.
(d) The measured resistance is approximately 16.834 Ohms, and the current is approximately 0.10373A.
The power dissipated by the thermistor is therefore P = I^2R = 0.181 W.
(e) T0 = 23.84 degreees Celcius, R(T0) = 15.73 Ohms.
(f) ln(R/R0) = alpha*T - alpha*T0 + beta*T^2 + beta*t0^2 -2*beta*T0*T
Hence T(R) = (2*beta*T0 - alpha - sqrt((alpha - 2*beta*T0)^2 - 4*beta*(beta*t0^2 -2*beta*T0*T - ln(R/R0))*(1/(2*beta))
T(R) = 263.84 - 5000*sqrt(0.002304 + 0.0004*ln(R/15.73))
