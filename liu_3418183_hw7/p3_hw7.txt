(a) When set to 5%, the voltage shown in the oscilloscope consists of two peaks 
of opposite directions (the positive peak higher than the lower peak by approximately 0.2V),
with amplitudes of 2V. 
The two wavelets are of the shape of triangles.
(b) When change the cycle to 10% the voltage amplitude changes by only about 0.2V,
but the distance between the two wavelets changes. 
With 5%, there is a distance of 20 micro-seconds.
With 10 %, there is a distance of 40 micro-seconds.
When the duty cycle is set to zero, there is no voltage shown, a linear line.
When duty cycle is briefly set to 100%, the voltage line remains a linear line with small peaks.
This is because when it's 100%, the PWM is always on, so it will not go to the off position.
When the duty cycle is 10%, 10% on means 10% of the time the wave is in the on position, 
so there are wavelets showing the PWM is on.
(c) Capacitance, C = 1 micro-F
frequency, f = 36kHz.
Capacitor impedance, XC = 1/(2*pi*f*C) = 4.42 Ohms.
