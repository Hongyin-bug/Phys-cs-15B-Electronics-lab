The magnitude of temperature oscillations are reduced by approximately a half.
With a set point of 35 degrees, the highest temperature attained with the 3% 
duty cycle is about 41 degreees celcius. 
The duty cycle I chose was 5%, the oscillations at the two different temperatures
are 4 to 5 degrees celcius.
